<img src="ys.jpg" alt="Young Sheldon">
<p>. The series follows Sheldon Cooper's early life as a child prodigy in the fictional town of Medford, Texas. 
    As he grows up, he tries to fit into a world of people, including his own family and friends, 
    who struggle to cope with his intellectual capabilities and social ineptitude.</p>

    <h3>Sheldon Cooper</h3>
    <img src="sheldon.png" alt="Sheldon">
    <p>"is characterized by a strict adherence to routine and hygiene, an overly intellectual personality, 
        a tenuous understanding of irony, sarcasm and humor, and a general lack of humility or empathy</p>
    </div>
    <div class="movie-item">

    <h3>Missy Cooper</h3>
    <img src="missy.png" alt="Missy">
    <p> She is portrayed as a bratty, snarky, cynical 9-year-old who fights with Sheldon for attention 
        from their parents. This pushes her and Georgie closer together, whether 
        it's helping each other with homework or trading favors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="movie-item">

    <h3>Georgie Cooper</h3>
    <img src="georgie.png" alt="Georgie">
    <p> He comes across as a cocky and a bit lazy teen who has low intelligence despite his younger 
        brother Sheldon overshadowing him with vast knowledge, which could get on Georgie's nerves at times.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="movie-item">

    <h3>Mary Cooper</h3>
    <img src="mary.png" alt="Mary">
    <p> She was usually cheerful, was very rarely downcast, and possessed an ever-sunny disposition. 
        Mary indulged in free and frequent expression of her emotional feelings and was never 
        observed to be sorrowful until after the sudden death of Joseph.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="movie-item">

    <h3>George Cooper</h3>
    <img src="george.png" alt="georgeL">
    <p>He is a loving father and has defended Sheldon on multiple occasions, 
        earning Sheldon's love and appreciation. Contrary to Sheldon's memories in adult time, 
        he is no alcohol-abusing Texas redneck, but he does drink a lot.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="movie-item">
        
    <h3>Meemaw</h3>
    <img src="meemaw.png" alt="Meemaw">
    <p>Meemaw is a wonderful, warm, loving, sweet and wise grandmother who's protective and caring for Sheldon. 
        She calls him "Moon-pie" because he's so "nummy-nummy, she could just eat him up!"</p>
